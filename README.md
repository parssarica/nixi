# Nixi

Nixi is a package manager I built for fun. It's fast and lightweight. I picked two example packages. They are:


afetch: Fast and simple system info (for UNIX based operating systems) written in POSIX compliant C99. Original repository: https://github.com/13-CF/afetch

cpufetch: cpufetch is a simple, yet fancy, CPU architecture fetching tool. It currently supports x86_64 CPUs (both Intel and AMD), ARM, and PowerPC. Original repository: https://github.com/Dr-Noob/cpufetch
